# Hash tables are address bases of key-value pairs, which are run through what's called a Hash Function to be allocated.
# Hash Functions give unique memory addresses for the value that is stored by the key. Python dictionaries work alike.

# They hold two properties:
# - Deterministic: The Hash Function will generate a unique address for every key, even with different values associated
# - One-way: Meaning you can't go from the value to the key, only from the key to the value

# Collisions:
# Given the deterministic property, a Hash Function may generate the same address to different values -> collision.
# Collisions may be sorted through various different ways. Most common are called Separate Chaining and Linear Probing
# - Separate Chaining: Each memory address will be a list that contains all the values assigned to it, sequentially
# - Linear Probing -> Open Addressing: This means that the function will find an empty spot for the value to assign it,
#                                      making the memory addresses hold only one value.

# This Hash Table implements Separate Chaining through lists, but you could use Linked Lists for this purpose as well.
