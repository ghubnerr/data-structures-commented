# Bubble sort involves bubbling up the largest item by comparing two terms and swapping them into order

        # Iterate over the unsorted portion of the list

                my_list[j] = my_list[j+1]  # Swap the current element with the next element

# Time Complexity: The bubble sort algorithm has Î˜(n^2) and O(n^2). This is because it involves two nested loops, resulting in a quadratic time complexity. 
# Space Complexity: Bubble sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it operates directly on the input list without requiring additional space proportional to the input size. No auxiliary data structures are used, so it is O(1).
